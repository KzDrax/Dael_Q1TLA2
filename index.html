                I am a College Student  studying at University of Immaculate Conception. <br>
                I am currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. <br>
                I am a 2nd year student currently enrolled in my 1st semester of the academic year 2025-2026. <br>
                <br>
                My journey towards my web development just started when I entered my 2nd year in College. <br>
                I don't really have much knowledge about web development, and this is my first exposure to web development in my web dev Course in my 1st sem of my 2nd year. <br>
                As of the moment of writing this, I have the skills to  program using Java, C, and Python. And HTML and CSS for my web dev that I'm currently taking. <br>
                <br>
                As a demonstration of my skill I will show you one of my project that I worked with a couple of my classmates. <br>
                The project is called "Project Pink" and it is a project in which we, my classmates and I decided to create a visual novel using java and limiting ourselves to only use Netbeans as our IDE. <br>
                Here are the images of the project that we created. <br>
